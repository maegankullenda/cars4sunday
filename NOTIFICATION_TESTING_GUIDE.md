# Push Notifications Testing Guide

## Current Status

✅ **FCM Implementation Complete**: All Android components are implemented and working
❌ **Cloud Functions Not Deployed**: Requires Firebase Blaze plan upgrade

## Why You Didn't Get Notifications from Manual Firestore Edits

When you manually edited an event description in the Firestore database, no notification was sent because:

1. **Cloud Functions are not deployed** (they trigger the notifications)
2. **Manual Firestore edits don't trigger app logic** (only Cloud Functions respond to database changes)
3. **Your Firebase project is on the Spark (free) plan** (Cloud Functions require Blaze plan)

## How to Test Notifications Right Now

### Method 1: Test FCM System (Recommended)

1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Login as an admin user**
3. **Go to Events screen**
4. **Tap "Test FCM Notification" button**
5. **You should see a test notification**

This verifies:

- ✅ FCM is configured correctly
- ✅ Notification permissions are granted
- ✅ Your device can receive notifications
- ✅ The notification system works

### Method 2: Test New Event Notifications

1. **Login as admin**
2. **Create a new event using the app**
3. **All users (including you) should receive a "New Event Available!" notification**

### Method 3: Test Event Update Notifications

1. **Attend an event** (so you're in the attendees list)
2. **Edit the event using the app** (not Firestore directly)
3. **You should receive an "Event Updated" notification**

## To Get Full Automatic Notifications

### Upgrade to Firebase Blaze Plan

1. **Visit**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/carsonsunday/usage/details
2. **Click "Upgrade to Blaze"**
3. **Set spending limit** (e.g., $5/month for safety)
4. **Deploy Cloud Functions**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

### Cost Information

- **Free Tier**: 2M function invocations/month
- **After Free Tier**: $0.40 per million invocations
- **Your Expected Usage**: Likely to stay within free tier
- **Safety**: Set spending alerts in Firebase Console

## What Happens After Cloud Functions Deploy

### Automatic Notifications Will Work For:

1. **New Events**:

   - Trigger: Any new event created
   - Recipients: All users with notifications enabled
   - Message: "New Event Available! [Event Title] - [Date]"

2. **Event Updates**:
   - Trigger: Significant changes (title, date, location, description)
   - Recipients: Only attendees of that specific event
   - Message: "[Event Title] [change description]"

### Manual Firestore Edits Will Also Work

Once Cloud Functions are deployed, even manual edits in the Firestore console will trigger notifications because the Cloud Functions listen to database changes.

## Troubleshooting

### No Test Notifications?

1. **Check notification permissions**: Settings > Apps > CarsOnSunday > Notifications
2. **Check Do Not Disturb**: Make sure it's off or allows app notifications
3. **Check app logs**: Look for FCM token in Android Studio logs
4. **Try different devices**: Test on multiple devices/emulators

### Still No Notifications After Cloud Functions Deploy?

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Functions > Logs for execution errors
2. **Check Firestore Rules**: Ensure write permissions are correct
3. **Check FCM Tokens**: Verify tokens are stored in user documents
4. **Check Function Triggers**: Ensure functions are triggered by database changes

## Current Test Implementation

The app currently includes temporary test code that:

- ✅ Shows notifications when events are created via the app
- ✅ Shows notifications when events are updated via the app
- ✅ Provides a manual test button for admins
- ✅ Logs FCM tokens for debugging

**Note**: Remove test code after Cloud Functions are deployed and working.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current implementation** using the methods above
2. **Verify notifications work** on your device
3. **Decide whether to upgrade to Blaze plan** for automatic notifications
4. **Deploy Cloud Functions** if you upgrade
5. **Remove test code** after Cloud Functions are working

The notification system is fully implemented and ready - it just needs the Cloud Functions deployed to work automatically with all database changes (including manual Firestore edits).
