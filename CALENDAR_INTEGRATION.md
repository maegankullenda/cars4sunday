# Calendar Integration Feature

## Overview

The CarsOnSunday app now includes automatic calendar integration that adds events to the user's local phone calendar when they choose to attend an event. This provides a seamless way for users to receive notifications through their existing calendar app.

## Requirements

### Google Account Setup

- **Google Account Required**: To use calendar features, users must have a Google account added to their device
- **Calendar App**: Works with Google Calendar and other calendar apps that support Android's calendar provider
- **Permissions**: Calendar read/write permissions are required

### Setup Instructions

1. Add a Google account to your device (Settings > Accounts & sync)
2. Grant calendar permissions when prompted
3. Attend events in the app - they'll automatically appear in your calendar

## Features

### 1. Automatic Calendar Addition

- When a user clicks "Attend" on an event, it's automatically added to their default calendar
- Events are added with a 15-minute reminder notification
- All event details (title, description, location, date/time) are preserved

### 2. Deep Link Integration

- Each calendar event includes a custom URL that links back to the event in the app
- URL format: `carsonsunday://event_detail/{eventId}`
- Users can tap the link in their calendar to open the event details in the app

### 3. Smart Calendar Management

- Events are automatically removed from the calendar when users leave an event
- Duplicate prevention - won't add the same event twice
- Calendar status is displayed in the UI for attending users

### 4. Permission and Account Handling

- Graceful handling of calendar permissions

### Deep Link Handling

- Navigates to event detail screen

## User Experience

### Setup Flow

1. User attends an event in the app
2. If no Google account is set up, show guidance dialog
3. If no calendar permissions, show permission dialog
4. Once requirements are met, event is added to calendar
5. User receives calendar notification 15 minutes before event
6. User can tap the event in their calendar to open it in the app

### Visual Indicators

- Calendar status is shown for attending users with specific messages:
  - Red text for missing requirements
  - Green text for successful calendar integration

- Clear guidance provided to users

### No Google Account
